**Description the course**

In this course, we will discuss Java Concurrent and Multithreaded Programming in detail. The course covers basic topics such as threads creation, synchronization, memory model and a happens-before relationship. There are lectures about standard Java classes that help to write complex concurrent programs. Also, there are advanced sections about concurrent algorithms, performance and monitoring.

#### What youâ€™ll learn

-   Java multithreaded programming
-   Concurrency and threads synchronization
-   Java basic and advanced synchronization primitives
-   Parallel algorithms
-   The java-util-concurrent package in detail
-   Performance, testing and debugging of multithreaded applications

#### Are there any course requirements or prerequisites?

-   Knowledge of Java basics or experience with other object-oriented programming language
-   Understanding of object-oriented programming concepts
-   Understanding of standard data structures: list, array, set, map

#### Who this course is for:

-   Java developers
-   Programmers who are migrating to Java
-   People who are interested in programming of concurrent and multithreaded applications
